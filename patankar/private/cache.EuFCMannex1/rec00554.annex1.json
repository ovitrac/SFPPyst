  "Restrictions": "Only to be used: a) with 1,6-hexanediol in the manufacture of polycarbonate pre-polymers that are used at up to 30 % to manufacture thermoplastic polyurethanes with 4,4&#39;-methylenediphenyldiisocyanate and diols, such as polypropylene glycol and 1,4-butanediol. The resulting material shall only be applied in repeated use articles intended to come into short-term contact (â‰¤ 30 min at room temperature) with food for which simulants A and/or B are assigned in Table 2 of Annex III; or b) for the production of other polycarbonates and/or under other conditions provided that the migration of dimethyl carbonate does not exceed 0,05 mg/kg food and that the migration of all polycarbonate oligomers with a molecular weight below 1 000 Da together does not exceed 0,05 mg/kg food.",
  "NotesCompliance": "V27 When a final material/article containing this substance, produced under conditions not described in (a) column10 Table1 is placed on the market, a method suitable for use by a competent authority to determine if oligomer migration complies with restrictions in (b) column10 Table1 shall be described in the supporting document referred to in Art.16. Reference shall be made if a method is publicly available. If it requires a calibration sample, a sufficient sample shall be supplied on its request.",
