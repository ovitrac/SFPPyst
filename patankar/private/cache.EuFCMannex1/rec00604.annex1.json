  "Restrictions": "Only to be used as a monomer in the production of polyethylene furanoate.The migration of the oligomeric fraction of less than 1 000 Da shall not exceed 50 Âµg/kg food (expressed as furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid).",
  "NotesCompliance": "V22 When used in contact with non-alcoholic foods for which Table 2 of Annex III assigns food simulant D1, food simulant C shall be used for verification of compliance instead of food simulant D1.V23 When a final material/article containing this substance is placed on the market, a well described method suitable for use by a competent authority to determine oligomer migration compliance with the restrictions in column 10 Table 1 shall be part of the supporting document referred to in Art. 16. Reference shall be made if an adequate method is publicly available. If it requires a calibration sample, a sufficient sample shall be supplied to the competent authority on its request.",
