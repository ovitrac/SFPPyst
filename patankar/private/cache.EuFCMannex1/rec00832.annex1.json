  "Restrictions": "Petroleum hydrocarbon resins, hydrogenated are produced by the catalytic or thermalpolymerisation of dienes and olefins of the aliphatic, alicyclic and/or monobenzenoidarylalkene types from distillates of cracked petroleum stocks with a boiling range not greater than 220 °C, as well as the pure monomers found in these distillation streams, subsequently followed by distillation, hydrogenation and additional processing.Properties: Viscosity at 120 °C: &gt; 3 Pa.s,Softening point: &gt; 95 °C as determined by ASTM Method E 28-67,Bromine number: &lt; 40 (ASTM D1159),The colour of a 50 % solution in toluene &lt; 11 on the Gardner scale,Residual aromatic monomer ≤ 50 ppm.",
