No. 71519-80-7). The resins are produced by the condensation of 4,4'- isopropylidenediphenol, carbonyl chloride, terephthaloyl chloride, and isophthaloyl chloride such that the finished resins are composed of 45 to 85 mole percent ester, of which up to 55 mole percent is the terephthaloyl isomer. The resins are manufactured using a phthaloyl chloride/carbonyl chloride mole ratio of (0.81 to 5.7)/1 and isophthaloyl chloride/terephthaloyl chloride mole ratio of 0.81/1 or greater. The manufacturing process may include optional adjuvant substances authorized for the resins.",
